The GPIO namely, General-Purpose Input Output module
gives the access of outside world to the processor and vice
versa. Be it sensors or actuators or switches are connected to
the processor through this module.

 In TIVA TM4C123GH6PM Launch Pad there are 43
programmable input/output pins divided into 6 ports.

 The Port F is special as it has an onboard LED connected and
two onboard switches connected in negative logic.The GPIO module needs to be configured prior to the usage. In
embedded-C we generally use a initialization function to configured
the port we are going to use. These simple steps make sure that all the
ports are configured and initialized. The GPIOLOCK register enables write access to
the GPIOCR register 0x4C4F434B to the GPIOLOCK
register unlocks the GPIOCR register.

Writing any other value to the GPIOLOCK
register re-enables the locked state. Reading the
GPIOLOCK register returns the lock status rather than
the 32-bit value that was previously written.This register is only valid for ports and pins that can be used as ADC AINx inputs.
• If any pin is to be used as an ADC input, the appropriate bit in GPIOAMSEL must
be set to disable the analog isolation circuit.
• The GPIOAMSEL register controls isolation circuits to the analog side of a unified
I/O pad. Because the GPIOs may be driven by a 5-V source and affect analog
operation, analog circuitry requires isolation from the pins when they are not used in
their analog function
